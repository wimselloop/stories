Thirty-Fourth Journal entry of Maevis B. Morgan, Author


I spent the day and evening in Aunt Beatrice’s house, I went through the left front door this time. Results not in yet.

I replaced the batteries in my audio recorder so I’ve speech-to-texted the transcript here. 

ACT I: Mom drops me off, forgets to get leave the dog food for Dooley. I can tell she’s accelerating by the time she gets halfway down the driveway, which doesn’t make much sense for the brakes, but that’s Mom. She’s got more places to be than places to stay.

The day is sunny, but cool. Dooley’s already found the chicken and is harassing it playfully. I’m giving it two or three days before we find it dead somewhere, probably from shock. It will have half its feathers by that point. Nan will not notice it’s missing for probably a week and a half. There are fourteen of them, living in the shed, under the house, and in the surrounding trees, I think. Nan isn’t good with numbers.




Maeve’s Age-to-Going-on-Age chart was fascinating to Blueberry, and it was pretty hard to fascinate Blueberry in general. Everything that did fascinate her - at least, until somewhat later on in life - involved math. Specifically, Geometrical math, which most of her friends simply called “Stupid Geometry”, possibly because they found it hard, but more probably because they were all eleven years old. No self-respecting eleven-year old wants to hear about math, just then. Most are still coming to terms with the fact they’ve just shifted into double-digits, and will soon be in their twenties, no longer children, or really allowed to do childish things. Many of them also felt worried they would never add the next decimal place, because the space between each of those got an order of magnitude further out from the next. It was all too much to process, what were they doing getting kids to use this newfound sorcery to draw circles and other shapes? For what end?

Well, Blueberry knew. But she got that you had to come to terms with some life stuff before the meaning behind the math made much sense. She had gotten all her stuff about life (at the time) more or less dealt with, because she was smart, and also lucky enough to have parents who understood her, so the life stuff was minimal and came with a lot of free consulting.

Blueberry chose only friends who were exactly two years older than she was, and born within the same season (her father referred to them as Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, his least favourite Season). In this way, she was always, more or less, hanging around with kids her age, plus two. If Blueberry’s age was n, then her friends were all n+2 years old, give or take the specifics of when birthdays happened, which didn’t impact Blueberry’s analytics, since she considered that more in the realm of Numerology, which she knew she must by definition by opposed to dabbling in.

Blueberry had known Maeve for as long as either girl could remember, but for rather different reasons. Blueberry remembered more or less everything that had happened to her from about 11 months onward. Before that, it got a little fuzzy. Maeve, on the other hand, lost her memory now and then, for reasons as yet unknown to the local experts, scientists, well-wishers, and others. Everybody had just collectively decided it was best not to tell her – what good would it do? Maeve already had problems remebering things, she certainly didn’t need to stop trying to.

Blueberry of course had a theory, recently arrived at, but it was a problematic one. It was not possible, of course, but Blueberry had allowed herself to think that Maevis Morgan had been put under a witches’ curse.

This made no sense, since there were no real witches who could cast real witch spells. Obviously. It was all so much new-age nonsense, she knew that.

Yet. For all the information by that time available to the seven-year-old-acting-as-nine, through Internet and her social circle, there had never been a confirmed case reported of a person who kept forgetting people specific people, and not others. This is, as far as Blueberry could tell, what had been going on for the past six years or so, ever since the issue of memory had come to visit them both.

Anyhow, Maeve’s Age-to-Going-On-Age chart, a thing Blueberry had carefully and secretly plotted from the moment both girls started remembering (in Maeve’s case, again), had many plot points, and a very beautifully perfect arc. That her observations rather perfectly met her analysis in a very perfect arc wasn’t something the young scientist took lightly, at all. She was in fact so stunned by it that she decided – just this one time – not to share her findings with either of her parents. They were scientists and connected. There could be vans in front of the Morgan’s place (what Blueberry called it) by morning.

What Blueberry knew about this kind of curve is that it showed an artfully mathematical relationship between her friend’s actual age (well, in Earth years anyhow), and the age at which she technically functioned, according to a number of by-then open-source metrics freely available to anybody with the time and interest in connecting them properly, using math. 

This is called something in the science world – taking formulas and observations and then predicting something might come out the other end, that could be interesting. Like a curve, or a pattern, or a point, or something otherwise illustrative.

Working adult, properly accredited scientists would no doubt hotly contest Blueberry’s methods had they been employed in a professional capacity, and assume she began with a perfect arc, and then did some reverse-engineering to create her method – the brush she used to make the chart. But that had simply not been so, and attacking the scientific observations and declarations of nine-year-olds was something most self-respecting scientists would not think to do. They were, after all, scientists. So, Blueberry’s findings were always admitted to the various closed, science-based Facebook pages that Blueberry’s parents did not know she belonged to, and the discussion was always polite and respectful, if not occasionally spirited.

As Maeve’s actual age advanced, at least, for the past 11 years or so, her going-on-age, a routine Blueberry hit on one evening, after a particularly numbers-soaked dream, had produced, on its very first run, a perfectly, increasingly ascending arc.

Her friend Maeve was in fact eleven-currently-going-on thirty-three. She had all the markers, pretty much.
