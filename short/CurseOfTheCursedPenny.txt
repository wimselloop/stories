"You know I came in last place, right?"

"Stop it, M00t. This isn't healthy" Cleep wasn't kidding.

Cleep didn't want to go into this a second time, much less a fourth. Mooter (what he called his friend internally when he began to become annoyed with him) had insisted on the final edit, which had been expansive, if that can be believed. He had initally written it in binary, so that it could be replicated onto a single 64-gauge memory filament, and had therefore also chosen to make it unusually short, even for  a short story. Cleep had suggested several edits, which taken together amounted to an actual story of sorts, with the simplest of plots, but his friend Moot, thought Cleep, cooling down quickly, had preferred his own reductionist version.

Cleep knew that, every JuniorBot had that problem from time to time, some, unfortunately, for All Time. At least, theoretically. Re-engineering could fix some habits, but others were simply permanently broken. 

"I'm supposed to worry about the viability of your story, Moot, you've hored me as an editor. An unpaid one, but I still take that role responsibly." His two auxiliary port indicators lamps flashed three times in confirmation.

"Well, I suppose I should expect to get what I pay for, then." 




  


"We shouldn't have stolen that Cursed Copperpiece, Grubbins, Old Chum", snorted BowFellows, a short and hot bolt of lightning streaking past his head, as he ducked back down behind the rock both men had simulataneously chosen to hide behind, the moment after everything went South. That is an expression that means they were in a mess, which is sort of a metaphor about them being about to die. I mean, the chances were fairly good. About the diying happening. 

Grubbins had curled himself into the smallest possible ball of large and quivering
