Guardian Squirrel
[Hermetic Classification: Giant Flying Squirrel]

The Guardian Squirrels of LightningFork Isle call themselves
Guardfolk, due to their general alignment to Nature and its most vulnerable denizens. They are often excellent at what they choose to do, though they often have a difficult time deciding what it is, that is.

LightningFork Isle derives its name from the twin lightning towers accidentally erected some two-hundred years prior to the age this game concerns itself with.
