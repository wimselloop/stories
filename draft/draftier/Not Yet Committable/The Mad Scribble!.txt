The Mad Scribble, simply put, was a Wizard's way of working out the tangled thoughts within her or his head, by letting it all go onto paper, or into some other form.

Usually, the Wizard would begin by doing some gentle stretching, or perhaps jogging in place, or some other preparation ritual, pull up a comfortable chair (ideally with good ergonomics), and then begin to put (so to speak) their words to their thoughts out into the world, to see what thoughts might come back in return. This seemed like sensible practice to most common folk who came to hear of it - since common folk were nothing if not practical, in those days - and many fairly unwizardly folk came to enjoy the Centuries-old, deeply venerated practice of the Mad Scribble as well, much to the consternation of those centuries-old venerators of the whole thing.
