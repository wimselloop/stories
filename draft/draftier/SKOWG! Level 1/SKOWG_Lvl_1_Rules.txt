Some Kind of War Game, Level 1

The Skowgs had been at war for centuries, perhaps longer. None of them knew anymore, but they had all begun to grow rather tired of it. Then one day, they decided to change, but only a little.

They stopped hitting each other, which they used to do, a lot. They had become all bruised and jumpy, after so many years of doing that to each other.

Being Skowgs, they of course could not stop quarrelling over all the things they did before, when they were still hitting each other with their thumping poles. They quarreled over land and gems and trees and Flutterfigs and better views and many other things. So they stil fought, only they chose to do that by waving their thumping poles at one another, and sometimes shouting, to chase each other away.

Skowg wars are now fought by numbers and shouting. When two Skowg armies meet, they first compare how many skowgs are in each army. Then they play shout cards (which players should never emulate, it is too rude to be shouting at boardgame distance) that add bonuses to their total skowgs, until one side decides to stop shouting, or runs out of shout cards. Then, the army that has waved enough thumping poles and shouted the most wins, sending the other amry scurrying home, leaving a gold nugget behind, if they have one. Both armies also get tired, after all that shouting. When they return to their homes, they can regenerate their shout cards.
