Raising Maevis Morgan as a young child, well at all ages, actually, was much like reading a Whodunnit novel that simpy never ended. It was both fascinating and also exhausting. In the end, it would seem, things turned out very well - except perhaps for that One Thing - for both her mother and the child.

Ani liked mystery novels well enough, but wwas more of a Star Wars fan, so tended to think about her children as miniature Jedi and Sith Lordesses.

She believed that there were two one-percents - one at the top, and one at the bottom, energy-scale-wise. Conservative and liberal were altogether different angles in that all-round compass. That last bit was from her Aunt, Bee. Bee liked Star Wars too, once she found out about it on Youtube.
