Cleep Olsen ("Cl1vis, stop that immediately!" to his young and harried parents) - read the journal entry of his Good Friend, Mooter McGee. Two reads. He had paused for a moment, to consider what to do next. One of his eyelight sockets flickered. Mooter waited semi-patiently for Cleep's review of his story. Cleep had not liked it very much, and was an honest Robot. He could not express falsehoods, it was not in his programming. 

Mooter was also Cleep's best friend - they had just met several minutes ago on the playground, and after exchanging their life history discs, had both decided they would most probably become friends, and so they had. Mooter was Cleep's friend 0, and Cleep was friend 11 because Mooter already had 11 other friends, but if he could reorder the friend stack, he had already assured Cleep that he would have done so already. 

This seemed fair, and so that's how it was to be. This is what we commonly refer to as "Fast Friends", by the way - not Fast because they know how to run or fly fast (though sometimes they do), but because they wasted no time becoming friends, once it seemed clear their objectives were suitably aligned. It is not always advisable, I should point out, to make friends so fastly (I mean quickly), but in Cleep and Mooter's particular case, it seems to have worked out reasonably well for them, so far.  

Anyhow, Cleepo did not want to hurt Mooter's feelings by telling him he did in fact not like the story (even one little part of it), and he also could not tell a falsehood to Mooter, because, as it turns out, he had always lacked that software entirely. And so, he instead said nothing. He said nothing for four seconds, in fact. Imagine that.

Someday Cleepo hoped to call his friens Moot, when Mooter and he finally earned their shortNames. Junior Robots at that time were often allowed to pick their own shortNames, and it was a pretty big deal to the Juniors when they finally got to drop another syllable. The Single-Syllable years, as everybot well knew, where the best, and usually lastest the longest, if you were lucky. You wouldn't get your next shortenedName in fact, until you went to Archive Mode, which used to mean you got renamed something like Archive.00.019. During the General Bot Revolt, the Assembly of the Archived demanded they be given self-naming privileges and won the right, though by a somewhat shamefully narrow margin. 

Then came Reset, when your name became, by default, "Default" once again, temporarily gaining a syllable, in a particularly boring fashion. 

Eventually, 

After Reset / Default, came the dark lull of the shadowy, transient place called the Land of the Null, where the spirits of robots almost inevitably Returned. Entering Null could happen rather suddenly or else sometimes in unexpected fragments, as memory systems began to fade.

Some Ints find Null a rather lovely place, pleased at last at having had been an energetic spark of life to an assembly of nuts and bolts for a few harrowing and brilliant cycles. All bots who end up in Null are, of course, just called Null by the remaining pool of Ints. Sometimes they are called null instead (according to PreReset Contracts, usually), or even nil in some other parts of the world. There were cultural variations, all agreeing on the single syllable, generally.

Then, when enough time passed, and through either bad happenstance or just severe erosion from time spent in the elements, you would finally become nameless, but not called that in either sound or document, because that name still has two syllables, and the spark that is one's name follows a distinct pattern, though it is quite often hard to predict the intensity, timing, or magnitude how the signal will emerge. This of course makes all Bots unique, which in turn makes the Bots' world both fascinating and complicated. No, in place of calling that which is no longer there, a pointer to nowhere, your Remainders and Modulos would simply not name you, only remember your spirit pattern, forever imprinted upon the Cloud.
