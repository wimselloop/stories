Hello, Disney!

If you have managed to find your way here, you either have very decent web-crawling algorithms, or else I've somehow managed to lure you here by sheer hopeful optimism, which is my favourite redundancy. Either way, I'm very happy you dropped by!

This is an experiment with open-sourcing my portfolio-in-the-constant-making, using the GitHub web service, and then sitting back and hoping you'll find it, eventually.

An open-source portfolio has a third axis of useful information, which is its modification history, which can be read like a stream, with a time signature. In the near future (if it's not already happening), studios as well as instructors may wish to observe portfolios-in-the-making, to assess things like the candidate's time management skills and personal process, and do so with standard, well-supported, open-sourced software tools.
