## The Wimsel Loop

This is a set of interconnected stories being developed toward manuscript form, using GitHub. 

Look in the draft/ folder (https://github.com/wimselloop/stories/tree/master/draft) to view the chapters currently in draft (Open Document Format).


## The Wimsel Loop on GitHub

I searched around for a while, looking at different platforms to write stories "in the open" (i.e. where readers, if they chose, could follow the process from draft to completed manuscript), and being a software developer, finally decided to just drop documents into a public repo, and see what happened.

## What order should you read these in?

The draft chapters / scenes WERE once numbered in the order I decided to release them in, which is roughly the order they were written in, though not in all cases. Since this might or might not have been the order they are finally arranged in, I eventually removed the chapter numbers, and will figure out what order to tell them in later, perhaps when I've found an editor, for reals. Feel free to read them in whatever order you feel like.
