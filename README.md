## The Wimsel Loop

This is a set of interconnected stories being developed toward manuscript form, using GitHub. 

Look in the draft/ folder (https://github.com/wimselloop/stories/tree/master/draft) to view the chapters currently in draft (Open Document Format).

## The Wimsel Loop on GitHub

I searched around for a while, looking at different platforms to write stories "in the open" (i.e. where readers, if they chose, could follow the process from draft to completed manuscript), and being a software developer, finally decided to just drop open source documents into a public repo, and see what happened.
