Story Quest : Searching the Well of Worlds


Every Wednesday by noon AST - because today's Wednesday, and Wednesday is Hump Day and we don’t celebrate that enough, and also Wednesday is spelled weird - I'll secretly update the position of the Well of Worlds, a number from 1 to 9. If the number of votes you cast in that call for votes equal the Magic Number, you get +3XP!


About the Well of Worlds
Fom the Field Notes of Forst Jodd-Hanz


The Well of Worlds chooses its position based on a simple formula. This formula was first postulated, experimented on, and affirmed to be likely true by the Governing Enclave of Field Scienstitians of Owl , all on an early Wednesday morning, in a beet field just East of Seven Tiny Churches, which is in the South-South-Western nook of Mogdew, in the Grand Duchy of Addlebright. 


In all the hubub surrounding the discovery, which quickly spread across the Scrollweb like a wheatfire, an unknown Hedge Wizard took the opportunity to self-publish the first official treatise on the subject, called, to the eternal chagrin of a great many Wizards to come  - "Innebrion Omnescentt, on the Wonderous Internal Workings of the Outer Well of Interleavened Inner Other Worlds". 


The name caught on with a small but extremely influential conclave from the Upper Edler Chambers of Owl, and no matter what anybody else could say from that point forward, “Innebrion Omnescentt, on the Wonderous Internal Workings of the Outer Well of Interleavened Inner Other Worlds” was the de-facto, go-to manual for understanding the Wells. Well, understanding how they worked, at least.


Well... 
More specifically, understanding where they would be, and when.


Knowing where they would be, and when.
Mostly.
